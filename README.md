# Experiment-6
*Simple To-Do List (JavaScript Local Storage)

*A To-Do List app lets users add, view, complete, and delete daily tasks.

*Uses HTML for structure (input box, add button, list).

*Uses CSS for styling the task list.

*Uses JavaScript to handle adding, displaying, marking complete, and deleting tasks.

*Each task is stored as an item in an array and saved in localStorage.

*Local Storage keeps data even after refreshing or closing the browser.

*On page load, the JavaScript script reads saved tasks from localStorage and displays them.

*When the user adds, completes, or deletes a task, the updated list is saved back to localStorage.
